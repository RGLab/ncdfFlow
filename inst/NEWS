1.1.1

FEATURES:
	-netCDF support for large data sets.
	-centralized storage of flow data in 3-D matrix (sample*channel*event)
	-fast data accessing,subsetting and splitting 
	-support all the related methods for flowSet
	 
KNOWN ISSUES:
	
	write meta data - ncdfFlow allows user to save the entire ncdfFlowSet object in ncdf file.
	Currently the meta data is first serialized in R and stored as raw vector in cdf. It can fail 
	when the meta data size exceeds the limit of serialization function.  
	 
CHANGES IN 1.1.2:

	1.Using temporary directory instead of working directory to store cdf file in creating ncdfFlowSet from flowSet 
	2.allow for user specified path in ncdfFlowSet_sync method to save the cdf in different location other than original one
	3.clone.ncdfFlowSet function:
		-change argument name to avoid confusion:sNewNcFile-->isNew ;newNcFile-->fileName 
		-avoid copying the entire cdf repository when clone subsetted ncdfFlowSet
		-fix the bug of inconsistent dimensions (sample*colnames) when create the new cdf file
	4.check whether source file exist in read.ncdfFlowSet
	5..writeSlice:
		-allow for either flowFrame or matrix to be added by
		-add sample name to the error message to help troubleshoot the problematic FCS file especially for loading large datasets
	6.add isNew=FALSE to split method to allow for splitting into multipe cdf files for the sake of parallel computing
	7.set compress=FALSE to disable compression mode of CDF
